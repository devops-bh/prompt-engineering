/* 
Rather than using the OpenAI API to upload a file and have 
the assistant (a GPT agent) parse the file, 
We could mimic this functionality as done below 
However the risk here is that the either 
- the file will need to be provided at the start of initiating a GPT instance 
    - when you go to ChatGPT, you can't guarantee the agent you are interacting with 
    is the agent you interacted with a week ago as your session may be different etc 
- or, even worse, the file (or, a representation of the file) will need to be provided during each prompt 

At first glance, using the completion API (rather than an assistant) seems easier at least in the short term, 
but if this were a project where longevity mattered, I'd figure out how to do this equivalent using the assistant 
API and the file upload endpoint. 

I briefly considered using the assistant API, but the API doc example uses the code interpreter tool, 
whereas I think we'd want to use the retrieval tool (honestly not sure if or which tool we'd use) 
And I think retrieval can become pretty costly, and honestly maybe overkill for our use case
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai#file-uploads
- https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/creating-assistants
^ I'm assuming its too much work but it'd be interesting if there was an analysis of the differences in costs 
regarding using a (retrieval?) assistant and using prompt injection via the chat completion API 
e.g. injecting file contents and/or remembering context 
I'm not sure if the file uploads endpoint is priced differently etc, and offcourse it depends on the volume of text 
There's probably ways of "compressing" chunks of text into representable embeddings which require less tokens too 
There's then the question of how much does the quality of responses etc vary?

const question = "is a debt management plan right for Amy Holmes?" 
Based on the data provided, Amy Holmes has a positive bank balance and her expenses seem manageable compared to her income. She is currently not in debt and appears to have financial goals like investing in stocks and starting a hobby.
Therefore, based on the information available, a debt management plan does not seem necessary or suitable for Amy Holmes at this time.
Comment: I actually like this response 
*/
/* 
//const question = "who is in debt?" // may need to tweak the Faker script so it generates people who are debt 
To determine who is in debt, we need to calculate the total expenses for each individual and compare it to their bank balance.

1. William Porter's total expenses:
Total Expenses = Rent/Mortgage + Utilities + Groceries + Transport + Leisure
Total Expenses = 429.84 + 264.22 + 838.0 + 751.89 + 370.34
Total Expenses = 2654.29

2. Amy Holmes's total expenses:
Total Expenses = Rent/Mortgage + Utilities + Groceries + Transport + Leisure
Total Expenses = 116.31 + 191.32 + 589.87 + 150.29 + 115.11
Total Expenses = 1163.90

3. Jason Joseph's total expenses:
Total Expenses = Rent/Mortgage + Utilities + Groceries + Transport + Leisure
Total Expenses = 752.65 + 261.54 + 753.58 + 984.91 + 233.72
Total Expenses = 2986.40

Now, let's compare the total expenses to their bank balances:

1. William Porter: Bank Balance - Total Expenses
Bank Balance = 5852.34, Total Expenses = 2654.29
Bank Balance - Total Expenses = 3198.05 (Positive balance, not in debt)

2. Amy Holmes: Bank Balance - Total Expenses
Bank Balance = 7706.55, Total Expenses = 1163.90
Bank Balance - Total Expenses = 6542.65 (Positive balance, not in debt)

3. Jason Joseph: Bank Balance - Total Expenses
Bank Balance = 3857.56, Total Expenses = 2986.40
Bank Balance - Total Expenses = 871.16 (Positive balance, not in debt)

Based on the calculations, none of the individuals - William Porter, Amy Holmes, or Jason Joseph are in debt.
Comment: I suspect its going to be tedious confirming GPT's math :| 
There may also be ways of tricking GPT into not returning the same entire response as this could become costly 

When changing William Porter's bank balance from 5852.34 to 0, the response will correctly be:  
Therefore, William Porter is the one who is currently in debt.

const question = `explain how a debt management plan can help Firstname Secondname in 3 different levels`
GPT says:  A debt management plan can help Amy Holmes in the following ways:

1. **Lower Interest Rates**: By enrolling in a debt management plan, Amy may benefit from lower interest rates on her existing debts. This can help reduce the overall amount she needs to pay back over time, making it easier for her to manage her finances effectively.

2. **Consolidated Payments**: With a debt management plan, Amy can consolidate multiple debt payments into one monthly payment. This simplifies her financial responsibilities and ensures that she does not miss any payments, helping her avoid late fees and penalties.

3. **Financial Education**: Debt management plans often come with financial counseling and education. By participating in 
such a plan, Amy can learn valuable money management skills and strategies to better handle her finances in the future. This can empower her to make informed decisions about her spending habits and financial goals.
*/

/* 
const question = `explain how a debt management plan can help Firstname Secondname in 3 different levels (child, adult, financial expert)`
GPT says:  A debt management plan can help Amy Holmes at different levels:

1. Child Level:
- A debt management plan can teach Amy about financial responsibility and planning at a young age, helping her understand 
the importance of budgeting and managing expenses wisely.
- By following a debt management plan, Amy can develop good financial habits early on, setting her up for a more secure financial future as she grows into adulthood.
- Learning to manage debt at a young age can prevent financial stress and difficulties in the future, ensuring Amy is better equipped to handle financial challenges as an adult.
^ so... it assumes that Amy is at a young age? This may come across as patronising or so? 

2. Adult Level:
- A debt management plan for Amy as an adult can help her consolidate her debts into a single manageable payment, making it easier for her to track and pay off her obligations.
- By working with a debt management plan, Amy can negotiate with creditors to potentially lower interest rates and fees, reducing the overall cost of her debt.
- The plan can provide Amy with a structured approach to gradually pay off her debts, ultimately improving her credit score and financial health over time.
^ again, mistook the explain in different levels prompt as an implication of the age 

3. Financial Expert Level:
- From a financial expert perspective, a debt management plan for Amy can involve analyzing her current financial situation, identifying areas of overspending, and creating a tailored plan to address her specific debt challenges.
- The expert can provide Amy with personalized advice on budgeting, saving, and investing to help her achieve her financial goals like investing in stocks or starting a hobby.
- By working with a financial expert through a debt management plan, Amy can gain valuable insights and guidance on how to make informed financial decisions and secure her financial future.
^ assumes that there is an expert, not that the level of the detail is to be of expert level 
*/

/* 
const question = `explain like I am 5 how a debt management plan can help Firstname Secondname`
GPT says:  A debt management plan can help Amy Holmes by creating a detailed plan to help her pay off any debts she may have. By carefully managing her expenses and income, Amy can work towards paying off her debts in a structured and manageable way. This plan can help Amy to reduce her financial stress and move towards achieving her financial goal of investing in stocks.
^ its nice that it relates to their CSV section 
*/


/* 
const question = `assume I am a financial expert when explaining how a debt management plan can help Firstname Secondname`
GPT says:  A debt management plan can be beneficial for Amy Holmes due to her current financial situation. Amy works as a 
Chiropodist and has a bank balance of $7706.55. Her monthly expenses include $116.31 for Rent/Mortgage, $191.32 for Utilities, $589.87 for Groceries, $150.29 for Transport, and $115.11 for Leisure.

A debt management plan can help Amy by analyzing her income and expenses to create a structured plan for repaying her debts. It can help her prioritize her payments, negotiate with creditors for lower interest rates or monthly payments, and consolidate her debts into more manageable installments. By following a debt management plan, Amy can work towards achieving 
her financial goal of investing in stocks and starting a hobby while also managing her debts effectively.

Additionally, the debt management plan can provide Amy with financial guidance and support to improve her overall financial well-being. It will help her track her expenses, save money, and gradually pay off her debts, ultimately leading to a more secure financial future.
^ much better (even though I'm slightly suspicious GPT isn't thinking of the banking concept of a debt management plan & instead is just thinking about the phrase in general)
